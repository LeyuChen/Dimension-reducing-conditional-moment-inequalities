# Dimension-reducing-conditional-moment-inequalities
Gauss codes for replicating the simulation results of Chen and Lee (2018) on dimension reducing conditional moment inequalities for discrete choice models
Description of the dimension reducing conditional moment inequalities and the simulation details can be found in the paper:

Chen, Le-Yu and Lee, Sokbae (December 2018), "Breaking the curse of dimensionality in conditional moment inequalities for discrete choice models".

This paper is forthcoming at Journal of Econometrics. The latest working paper version of this work can be found in this repository.
