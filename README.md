# Dimension-reducing-conditional-moment-inequalities
Gauss codes for replicating the simulation results of Chen and Lee (2019) on dimension reducing conditional moment inequalities for discrete choice models. 
Description of the dimension reducing conditional moment inequalities and the simulation details can be found in the paper:
